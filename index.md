Hello! Welcome to my page. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in philosophy of science at the [California Institute of Technology](http://www.hss.caltech.edu/content/boris-babic). The overarching theme of my research is **epistemic risk**. The various dimensions of this project span philosophy of science/formal epistemology, normative ethics, and law & public policy. You can learn more about epistemic risk by clicking on the Research tab. 

#### About Me
From 2013-2017, I was a student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I received a [PhD in Philosophy](https://lsa.umich.edu/philosophy) and [MS in Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats). My supervisor was [Jim Joyce](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jjoyce/). My dissertation was entitled, unsurprisingly, Foundations of Epistemic Risk. 

Prior to that, I studied law at [Harvard University](https://hls.harvard.edu/), and practiced briefly as an intellectual property lawyer at [Quinn, Emanuel, Urquhart & Sullivan](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/), where I represented companies fighting over fashion dolls, cell phones, and comic books. In particular, I spent most of my time representing Mattel, the makers of Barbie, in the now famous (infamous?) ["doll wars"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/22/when-barbie-went-to-war-with-bratz) against rival company, MGA, the makers of Bratz.
