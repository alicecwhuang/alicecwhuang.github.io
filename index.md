    <p>I am an assistant professor and the Duncanson Chair in Ethics and Technology at Western University, jointly appointed in <a href="https://www.csd.uwo.ca/">computer science</a> and in <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/philosophy/"> philosophy </a>. I am also a faculty affiliate at the <a href="https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca">Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology & Society</a>, and a core member of the <a href="https://www.rotman.uwo.ca">Rotman Institute for Philosophy of Science</a>. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://embeddedethics.seas.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>. </p>
    
  <p> I received my PhD in philosophy at the <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>.

  <p>I work primarily in the ethics of machine learning and social formal epistemology. My projects fall into two broad categories. The first kind of project connects formal results in artificial intelligence research to ethical issues related to interpretability, collaboration and fairness. The second kind of project uses formal and computational models to investigate pressing issues in our social discourse today, such as questions about misinformation, scientific practices and polarization.</p>

  <p>Before starting my PhD the University of Toronto, I studied philosophy and computer science at <a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/">New York University, Abu Dhabi</a>.</p>
