      I am a PhD candidate in philosophy at the [University of Toronto](https://philosophy.utoronto.ca), and a graduate fellow at the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology & Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca). For the second year now, I am also supported by the Pronovost Morgan Family Foundation Fellowship in Ethical AI.

      I work primarily in the ethics of machine learning and social formal epistemology. My projects fall into two broad categories. The first kind of project connects formal results in artificial intelligence research to our ethical reasoning. I think about how we should interpret different trade-offs found in machine learning and how we can make moral advice implementable and relevant for practitioners. The second kind of project uses formal models to investigate pressing issues in our social discourse today, such as questions about the value of diversity, misinformation, fairness, and polarization.

      Before starting my PhD the University of Toronto, I studied philosophy and computer science at [New York University, Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/).
