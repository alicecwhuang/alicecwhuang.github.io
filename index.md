Hi! Welcome to my page. I recently joined [INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in the Decision Sciences department. Previously, I was a postdoc at the [California Institute of Technology](http://hss.divisions.caltech.edu/people/boris-babic). I am primarily interested in (a) foundational questions in Bayesian inference and decision-making and (b) normative questions in the implementation of artificial technology and machine learning in organizations. 

<!--- The overarching theme of my research is **epistemic risk**. The core dimensions of this project span philosophy of science/formal epistemology, normative ethics, and law & public policy. The latter engages the emerging literature on fair AI and machine learning. You can learn more about epistemic risk by clicking on the Research tab. --> 

**About Me**

![profile_pic](/img/babic.jpg)

From 2013-2017, I was a student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I received a [PhD in Philosophy](https://lsa.umich.edu/philosophy) and [MS in Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats). My supervisor was [Jim Joyce](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jjoyce/). <!--- My dissertation was entitled, unsurprisingly, Foundations of Epistemic Risk.--> 

Prior to that, I studied law at [Harvard University](https://hls.harvard.edu/), and practiced briefly as an intellectual property lawyer at [Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/) in Los Angeles, where I represented companies fighting over fashion dolls, cell phones, and comic books. In particular, I spent most of my time representing Mattel, the makers of Barbie, in the now famous (infamous?) ["doll wars"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/22/when-barbie-went-to-war-with-bratz) against rival company, MGA, the makers of Bratz. 
<!-- And prior to that, [I mostly tried](/img/hockey.jpg), and failed, to become a professional hockey player. -->
