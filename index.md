Welcome to my page. I am an Assistant Professor at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), where I have a dual appointment in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/boris-babic) and the [Department of Philosophy](https://philosophy.utoronto.ca/directory/boris-babic/). I am also a faculty fellow of the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca) and a visiting professor in the Decision Sciences department at [INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/). 

I work primarily in ethics, law, and policy of artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially in medical applications. My research has appeared in Science, Nature Machine Intelligence, Nature Digitial Medicine, and the Harvard Business Review, among other venues. It has also been profiled in Forbes, STAT News, China Business News, Tencent QQ, and The Edge Markets (Singapore). I teach BA, MA, MBA, and PhD classes in statistics, philosophy, and decision making.

Before joining the University of Toronto, I was an Assistant Professor at [INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/), both in France and Singapore, and a postdoc at the [California Institute of Technology](http://hss.divisions.caltech.edu/people/boris-babic). I received a [PhD in Philosophy](https://lsa.umich.edu/philosophy) and [MS in Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I also received a [JD from Harvard Law School](https://hls.harvard.edu/), and practiced law at [Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/) in Los Angeles, where I represented companies fighting over fashion dolls, cell phones, and comic books. In particular, I spent most of my time representing Mattel, the makers of Barbie, in the now famous (infamous?) ["doll wars"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/22/when-barbie-went-to-war-with-bratz) against rival company, MGA, the makers of Bratz.
