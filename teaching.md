At the University of Toronto, I designed and taught the course __Persons, Minds and Bodies__ (PHL 240), with a focus on how new technologies can change our understanding of the mind and personal identity. You can find the syllabus [here](teaching/syllabus240.pdf).

I have taught students from a wide range of disciplines, including computer science, statistics, economics and cognitive science. Currently, I am designing a module on algorithmic fairness for third-year undergraduates in computer science, as part of the __Embedded Ethics__ project. [Here](teaching/fairness_material.pdf) you can find a sample of the material, including a worksheet, discussion questions and two sample problems for students. 

Other teaching experience as a TA:

* Probability and Inductive Logic
* Modern Symbolic Logic
* Theories of Mind
