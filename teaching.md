At the University of Toronto, I designed and taught the course Persons, Minds and Bodies (PHL 240), with a focus on how new technologies can change our understanding of the mind and personal identity. You can find the syllabus [here](teaching/syllabus240.pdf).

I have also lead tutorials for many other courses in the philosophy of mind, including Philosophy of Imagination, Theories of Mind, and Representation, as well as courses in logic and probability.

I have taught students from a wide range of disciplines, including computer science, statistics, economics and cognitive science. Currently, I am designing a module on algorithmic fairness for third-year undergraduates in computer science.
