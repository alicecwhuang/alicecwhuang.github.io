The following are what we might call the three tenets of the standard model of partial-belief (or Bayesian) epistemology: rational agents (1) possess coherent degrees of belief, (2) which they update by Bayesian conditioning on new evidence, (3) such that at any given point their degrees of belief are completely determined by their prior beliefs and the evidence they observed.

Each of the following topics deals with one of these tenets (naturally, the topics are not mutually exclusive). As you will see, they are given in descending degree of structure. If you want to answer a detailed prompt, you may want to write on topic 1; if you want some more freedom to structure your argument, consider topic 2; if you want to dive into open waters, topic 3 may be for you (I don't necessarily recommend this). Choose your own adventure.

Whichever topic you choose, however, it is important that you ultimately take a position rather than just explaining the competing views. For example: "I will argue that neither argument is compelling because..."

Topic 1. Coherence. Explain what coherence is, and how it relates to rationality. We have seen two arguments for coherence (Ramsey's pragmatic dutch-book argument, and Joyce's epistemic accuracy argument). Explain these two arguments and how they differ from each other. What do you take to be the core of each argument? Which is more persuasive, and why? You may want to consider whether the epistemic is truly non-pragmatic, and you may also want to consider whether we should seek a non-pragmatic argument to begin with. 

Topic 2. Updating. Why is updating by Bayesian conditioning the uniquely rational response to evidence (if it is)? For example, suppose I told you that the way I update my beliefs is by determining the Bayesian posterior, then going two-thirds of the way there. Is this irrational? Why or why not? Does you answer depend on the particular form of the non-Bayesian update (i.e. does it matter whether I go one third of the way to Bayes, two thirds, or do something else entirely)? Or, is every non-Bayesian updating procedure irrational? 

Topic 3. Priors. We have seen that without any constraint on an agent's priors, any belief may be a rational response to evidence. In other words, unless there are some constraints on where you start, the coherent and updating conditions only tell us whether the process by which an agent arrived at her current beliefs is rational. They do not tell us anything about whether her posterior belief itself is a rational belief to hold. Is this a problem? (consider the conspiracy examples). We have seen that some people argue for setting one's priors by applying the principle of indifference. Do you find this persuasive? Can you think of an alternative method for determining the rationality of prior beliefs?
