Whichever topic you choose, it is important that you ultimately take a position rather than just explaining the competing views. For example: "I will argue that neither argument is compelling because..."

**Topic 1**. Personal Identity. We explored three competing positions on the persistence of identity over time: John Locke's psychological continuity theory; Bernard Williams's (qualified) defense of the role of physical continuity; and Derk Parfit's so-called Relation R. Which of these theories do you find most persuasive? Why? You may also take the position that none of them are persuasive and identify a perspective of your own. 

**Topic 2**. Free Will. Identify and explain the most persuasive arguments for and against the existence of free will. Which do you find most persuasive? Why? In constructing your paper, consider the relationship between free will and moral/legal responsibility. 

**Topic 3**. Consciousness. What is Chalmers's hard problem of consciousness? Is it a problem? In constructing your answer, consider the Churchlands' competive perspective.
