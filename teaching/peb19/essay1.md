#### HPS/Pl 122: Probability Evidence and Belief 

#### First Paper Topics

Papers Due: February 22 (by e-mail to instructor) 

Word limit: 2000 words 

#### Topic 1: Probabilism 

Explain what Probabilism is as a norm of epistemic rationality. How does Joyce (1998) derive this norm? How does Joyce (2009) derive this norm? Comment on the difference between the two proofs. Which is more convincing? What is the “Bronfman Objection”? Is this objection persuasive? 

For this topic, you should consult the following entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (at a minimum, for a discussion of the Bronfman Objection): [epistemic utility](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-utility/). 

#### Topic 2: Likelihood

Explain Birnbaum's Formal Likelihood Principle and Hill's Restricted Likelihood Principle. How are they similar? How are they different? Which, if either, should we endorse as a principle of epistemic rationality (i.e., a normative constraint on rational scientific inference)? What, if anything, does this say about the Frequentist vs. Bayesian inferential procedures debate?

#### Topic 3: Stopping Rules

Explain the notion of a stopping rule, focusing on the distinctions we examined in class (eg., data dependant vs. non data dependant stopping rules). Can information about the stopping rule affect Bayesian inference? Can it affect Frequentist inference? Should it affect either? Why or why not? 

#### Topic 4: Priors 

Explain the maximum information entropy approach to identifying priors in Bayesian inference, comparing (as necessary) to the Laplacean Principle of Indifference and Jeffreys' invariance method. What is the Judy Benjamin Problem and why is it a problem for entropy maximizers? Do you find it persuasive or not?
