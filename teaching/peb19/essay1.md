### First Paper Topics

Papers Due: February 22 (by e-mail to instructor) 

Word limit: 2000 words 

#### Topic 1: Probabilism 

Explain what Probabilism is as a norm of epistemic rationality. How does Joyce (1998) derive this norm? How does Joyce (2009) derive this norm? Comment on the difference between the two proofs. Which is more convincing? What is the “Bronfman Objection”? Is this objection persuasive? 

For this topic, you should consult the following entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (at a minimum, for a discussion of the Bronfman Objection): [epistemic utility](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-utility/)
