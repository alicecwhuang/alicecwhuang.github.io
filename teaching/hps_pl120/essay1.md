Whichever topic you choose, it is important that you ultimately take a position rather than just explaining the competing views. For example: "I will argue that neither view is compelling because..."

**Topic 1**. Methodology of science. Popper articulates a view of science as progressing, not through confirmation, but rather through corroboration by way of falsifiability. Meanwhile, Howson and Urbach (as we saw in the Strevens notes) articulate a theory of scientific progress through confirmation of hypotheses by way of Bayesian updating on new evidence. Explain and assess both theories. Which do you find more compelling? Why? 

**Topic 2**. Philosophy and statistical practice. Andrew Gelman and Cosma Shalizi argue that Bayesianism, as understood in philosophy of science, is fundamentally incompatible with Bayesian data analysis. Indeed, they suggest that a deductive theory, more closely resembling what we saw in Popper, better captures the way Bayesianism works in practice. Do you agree? Why or why not? If you do agree with Gelman and Shalizi, how then should we model scientific progress (keeping in mind the problems we explored with Popper and related deductive theories)?

**Topic 3**. Are you convinced by Belot that so-called [orgulity](https://199227ef-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/gordonbelot/bayesianorgulity.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coHc1tWyP2xiEKQxCOEUuWQwo4CmHtWfmeLqZ5dpOBBXyjkdtIom0X2_uY-DzcEY-MvXC0QFzLjuXMT8akEozeiqvNmH9qQoZ59Y-3a_DvKO0oSb0gGAzIr-ObMypFSAV3An8UV6EtM4u5i6lQsrMtWtWgevyK4sPiFZJXNURBVFQY770nx9PCfstZfsrqwYswhWws4xMmYvNBaqOzAmVFRhzcsqQ%3D%3D&attredirects=0) is a problem for Bayesians? Why or why not? In constructing your argument, consider Pomatto and Sandroni's [paper](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~lpomatto/an_axiomatic_theory.pdf) on a theory of inductive inference.
