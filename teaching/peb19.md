# Probability Evidence and Belief 

Welcome to the Caltech Probability Evidence and Belief course for Winter 2019. 

Meetings: Thursdays 7-9:55pm. 
Location: Dabney Treasure Room.
Office Hours: Thursdays 6-7pm. 

## Grades and Deadlines 

Two 2000-3000 word essays (30 percent each), presentation (20 percent), and class participation (20 percent).

First essay: February 22. Second essay: March 18.

## Overview 

This course will be an advanced research level seminar in Bayesian or probabilistic epistemology. Bayesian epistemology adopts a decision theoretic perspective to the selection and assessment of belief states. In this sense, it finds applications in philosophical analysis, economic theory, and statistical decision theory. We will read recent papers on probabilism, conditioning, accuracy, calibration, symmetry, (in)coherence, priors, information entropy, convergence, and other recent topics in the field.

The aim of the course is to sharpen your ability to reason analytically about complex and difficult problems from a decision-theoretic perspective. 

I will not presuppose any background in philosophy. Rather, the course is advanced in the sense that we will work through challenging recent scholarship rather than learning from a textbook or anthology. While there are no prerequisites, some of the readings will require a strong background in probability and statistics. If you are worried about your prior mathematical background, speak to me in advance and I will recommend some remedial literature.
