# Applied Quantitative Methods for Management, Economics and Finance

Welcome to INSEAD's 2019 Quantitative Methods course in the Business Foundations Programme! I will post all materials to this page so as to provide a one-stop-shop for lecture notes, handouts, readings, exercises and solutions, cases and solutions, and supplemantary material.  

You can find the syllabus [here](001qm_syllabus_babic.pdf) and the schedule [here](002qm_schedule_babic.pdf).
