I am co-organizing, with Chris Hitchcock and Frederick Eberhardt, the 10th Workshop in Decisions, Games, & Logic, which will be held in June 2019 at Caltech. More information will be available here soon.

In 2016, I co-organized with Sara Aronowitz the [9th DGL Workshop](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~skaron/dgl/) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
