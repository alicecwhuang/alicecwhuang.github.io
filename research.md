**Overview**
  
The overaching theme of my current research is **epistemic risk**. It consists of three main components:

**Philosophy of science/formal epistemology**. I try to motivate and construct a general theory of epistemic risk in terms of alethic sensitivity to small changes in accuracy. This theory is currently developed within the epistemic utility/accuracy framework, though I think of this as a starting point rather than a fundamental commitment. If you would like to learn more, see _A Theory of Epistemic Risk_. Currently, I am working on a project that extends considerations of epistemic risk to the updating context (_Dynamic Epistemic Risk_). I am also working on a project on randomness and coherence for imperfect Bayesian agents (_A Challenge for Approximate Coherentism_) and a project that explores disparate measures of information in statistical theory (_Fisher Information vs. Shannon Entropy_).

**Normative ethics**. I think the theory of epistemic risk can fruitfully speak to several problems that have been articulated in the moral encroachment/ normative dilemmas literature. In a joint project with Zoe Johnson-King (_Moral Obligations and Epistemic Risk_), we explore the relationship between moral obligations and attitudes to epistemic risk.

**Law and public policy**. In _Testing for Discrimination and the Risk of Error_, I articulate and defend a standard for discrimination that can be readily implemented in large scale data analysis to evaluate the pervasiveness of racial profiling in police stops. Attitudes to error (i.e., to epistemic risk) play a key role for this standard. More broadly, this dimension of my research engages with the emerging literature on algorithmic fairness and ethics in statistics and machine learning.
