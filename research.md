I'm interested in the conceptual foundations of machine learning and the ethical, epistemic, and social implications of AI systems. I also use computational models to study opinion dynamics and collaboration. Below are some of my recent and ongoing projects:

### What Do We Really Want from Interpretability?

Interpretability is one of the most discussed topics in machine learning today, but what additional information do we actually need from a model, beyond its predictions? The answer depends on our goals. My research explores the conceptual landscape of interpretability, with several ongoing projects:

#### SSHRC Insight Development Grant

**Title:** *Beyond the Accuracy-Interpretability Tradeoff: Optimizing Human-AI Collaborations*

(With Chris Smeenk)

This project investigates what kinds of information, beyond predictions, can enhance human-AI team performance. We also draw lessons from physics to explore how we might establish the reliability of models we don't fully understand.

#### Caution Against Model Simplicity

I’m currently writing a paper arguing that simple, inherently interpretable models are not necessarily better at achieving our ethical goals, because functional form is not what is at issue.

#### Counterfactual Explanations and Contestability

(With Thomas Grote)

We examine whether counterfactual explanations genuinely empower individuals to contest automated decisions — and if so, how?

### Can Social Media Unpolarize Us?

While it is often believed that polarization dominates public discourse, some evidence suggests that society is not as polarized as it appears. There's also a puzzling correlation between opinions on unrelated topics (e.g., anti-climate action and pro-gun stances), suggesting that our multi-dimensional opinion space has collapsed into just two perceived dimensions.

I study how misperceptions of opinion space contribute to polarization, and whether dynamically configuring social connections could help restore a multi-dimensional opinion space.
