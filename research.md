#### Overview 

The overaching theme of my current research is **epistemic risk**. It consists of three main components:
  - **Philosophy of science/formal epistemology**. I try to motivate and construct a general theory of epistemic risk in terms of alethic sensitivity to small changes in accuracy. This theory is currently developed within the epistemic utility/accuracy framework, though I think of this as a starting point rather than a fundamental commitment. If you would like to learn more, see _A Theory of Epistemic Risk_. Currently, I am working on a project that extends considerations of epistemic risk to the updating context (_Dynamic Epistemic Risk_), a project that explores attitudes to risk of error for imperfect Bayesian agents (_A Challenge for Approximate Coherentism_), and a project that evaluates disparate measures of information in statistical theory (_Fisher Information vs. Shannon Entropy_). 
  
  - **Normative ethics**. I think the theory of epistemic risk can fruitfully speak to several problems that have been articulated in the moral encroachment/ normative dilemmas literature. In a joint project with Zoe Johnson-King (_Moral Obligations and Epistemic Risk_), we explore the relationship between moral obligations and attitudes to epistemic risk. 
  
  - **Public Policy**. In _Testing for Discrimination and the Risk of Error_, I articulate and defend a standard for discrimination that can be readily implemented to statistically evaluate the pervasiveness of racial profiling in police stops. Attitudes to error (i.e., to epistemic risk) play a key role for this standard. More broadly, this dimension of my research engages with the emerging literature on fairness in statistics and machine learning.
