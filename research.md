**Overview**
  
The overaching theme of my current research is **epistemic risk**. It consists of three principal components:

**Philosophy of science/formal epistemology**. I try to motivate and construct a general theory of epistemic risk in terms of alethic sensitivity to small changes in accuracy. This theory is currently developed within the epistemic utility framework, though I think of this as a starting point rather than a fundamental commitment. If you would like to learn more, see _A Theory of Epistemic Risk_. This project proposes a way of measuring the riskiness of a credence function and connects risk to measures of uncertainty. In particular, I show that under very general conditions epistemic risk is dual to information entropy. 

Currently, I am working on a project that extends considerations of epistemic risk to the updating of beliefs (_Dynamic Epistemic Risk_). I aim to show that we can establish an update rule by considering how an agent's attitudes to epistemic risk should change in response to different possible learning experiences. In particular, if the answer is that attitudes to epistemic risk should change as little as possible, then the associated update rule is Bayes' Rule. 

I am also working on a project on chance and coherence for imperfect Bayesian agents (_A Challenge for Approximate Coherentism_). I suggest that approximating coherence may not be an appropriate proxy for traditional (all or nothing) coherence because unlike the latter, approximating coherence is susceptible to misfortune. 

**Normative ethics**. I believe the theory of epistemic risk can fruitfully speak to several problems that have been articulated in the moral encroachment/ normative dilemmas literature. In a joint project with Zoe Johnson-King (_Moral Obligations and Epistemic Risk_), we explore the relationship between moral obligations and attitudes to epistemic risk.

**Law and public policy**. I also believe the theory of epistemic risk can be applied to public policy problems involving discrimination and racial profiling. In _Testing for Discrimination and the Risk of Error_, I defend a statistical test for discrimination grounded in attitudes to the rik of error, as measured by the general theory of epistemic risk I advocate. In _Adaptive Burdens of Proof_, I argue that many apparent paradoxes of proof arise because we assume that (without justification) that legal decision-makers must have one unique attitude to epistemic risk -- namely, neutrality. This assumption stands in stark contrast to theories of ordinary risk, where we understand that all decision-makers, including legal ones, can have a wide variety of attitudes to it. More broadly, this dimension of my research engages with the emerging literature on algorithmic fairness and ethics in statistics and machine learning.
